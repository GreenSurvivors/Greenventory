# SyncInv
Paper cross server player data syncing using redis and (optionally) [OpenInv](https://github.com/jikoo/OpenInv).

Provided without any (implied) support nor warranty! (See [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Minebench/SyncInv/blob/master/LICENSE#L589))

## Requirements

- [Paper](https://papermc.io) Minecraft server software (tested on 1.16.5+, should be the same version on all synced servers)
- [redis](https://redis.io) pub-sub
- [OpenInv](https://github.com/jikoo/OpenInv) (optionally, for a more smooth experience)

## Setup

1. Install redis, Paper, SyncInv (and optionally OpenInv).
2. Configure the SyncInv [`config.yml`](https://github.com/Minebench/SyncInv/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml):
    1. Specify the `server-name` for each server as set in your proxy config
    2. Setup the values for the pub-sub connection to your redis server in teh `redis` section
    3. Toggle the types of data you want to sync in the `sync` section
    4. Familiarize yourself with all the [other settings](https://github.com/Minebench/SyncInv/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml) and adjust if necessary (the most important one probably beeing the `required-servers` list and the `server-group` name if you want multiple different sync groups in your network)

## Download

Pre-build plugin jars can be downloaded from the [Minebench.de build server](https://ci.minebench.de/job/SyncInv/).
